So, MC-Gallimaufry is installed like any other mod, almost.  Open the jar move the .class files from MC-Gallimaufry.jar into your Minecraft.jar.  The take the things/ folder and place it in your .mincraft folder. It should be loaded at the same level as saves/. Make any adjustments you like to things/structList.txt before running Minecraft.  Place maps can be updated as the game runs and the next new instance of the site will load the new map.  Special thanks to Risugami for Modloader.  Nice bit of handles and utilities for Minecraft coding.  Also, many special thanks to Ocean Labs for Minecraft Coder Pack, without it none of this would be here.

For Full details check out the modest wiki at https://github.com/Datajax/MC-Gallimaufry/wiki

That's it for now.
Thanks,
Robert
