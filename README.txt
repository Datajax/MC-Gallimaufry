Quick notes about the project and the repo.  This repo will contain only the source I've created.  It is intended to work as an addon to MineCraft and a mod for it called mod loader.   Installation and acquisition may be covered at a later date in the wiki. For now, Google it.  If you are wanting to use the source directly you will also need the MCP (Mine craft coders pack) to decompile Minecraft and add in the current versions of source.  Otherwise there will be a .jar or .zip file in the repo that is the current working version of the mod.  To use that simply, download and add the .class files into the minecraft.jar.  Again, as I am focused on content at the moment. Google mod installation.

That's it for now.
Thanks,
Robert
